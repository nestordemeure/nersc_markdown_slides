# NERSC Markdown-based Slides

This repository contains the style information, as well as a number of demo slide decks, for NERSC's Markdown-based slides.

We are using [marp](https://marp.app/) as our engine.
But, [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/) might also be a meaningful choice.

## Instalation

Install `marp`:

```sh
npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli
```

## Usage

Building the slides into a PDF:

```sh
TODO
```

## TODO

* get a demo pdf to help with the styling
* gather the images I am using in my style
* create a spec for the style
* create a demo style
