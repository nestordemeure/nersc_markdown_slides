# JAX Workshop Slides - Porting Process

This slide deck was ported from [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bV5KD0w5VmYeXpWXwezXp9me07pNwCu24d4-ALlHLsA/edit?slide=id.g15c09839381_0_1#slide=id.g15c09839381_0_1) using the following process:

1. **Export**: Downloaded as PowerPoint (.pptx) from Google Slides
2. **Convert**: Used [pptx2md](https://github.com/ssine/pptx2md) to convert to Markdown
3. **Clean**: Refined content and formatting with Claude to match NERSC theme conventions

Note that [markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) might also have been a viable alternative, to be tested.
