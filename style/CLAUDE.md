## Styling

Updates to the style should be reflected in both the specification and CSS file.
Changing one should come with changing the other, and vice versa, unless a change is meant to get them in sync (i.e. the CSS not behaving as specified by the specification).

Do not test your visual fixes. Instead, invite the human user to build and check the result manually.
